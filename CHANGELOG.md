# SimpleNOC — Changelog

---

## v0.5.5.1 — UI / appearance (pre-release)
**Pre-release:** 2026-04-04

Dashboard and configuration UX improvements.

### Added
- **Settings (database retention)** — Header **Settings** opens a modal to view retention days per category. Values are now strictly hardcoded in the API via `noc_config.py` constants, eliminating database persistence to simplify deployment and configuration management.
- **API** — `GET /api/settings/retention` and `POST /api/settings/retention` logic now reads directly from config constants.

### Fixed / improved
- **Refresh** — Header **Refresh** runs `fetchAll()` and `fetchPing()`, and reloads the **active tab** (Alerts, TFTP, OLT, Uplink, Users) the same way as switching tabs, so the visible panel updates instead of only SNMP/syslog.
- **Light / dark theme** — Header and tab bar use theme variables (`--header-bg`, `--tabs-bg`) so they follow light mode; secondary text and chart tick/legend colors adjusted for contrast.
- **Readability** — Settings modal: larger type and stronger label/note contrast (especially light mode). Uplink traffic cards: larger secondary metrics, higher-contrast meta text, **Sampled** shows short date + time (`toLocaleString` options).
- **TFTP Start Crash Fix** — Fixed an indentation issue in `tftp_server.py` that caused the TFTP service to immediately crash on launcher start.
- **API Endpoint Fix** — Ensured robustness of API settings retrieval under Windows environment proxy handling by removing the `retention_settings.py` external dependency natively resolving HTTP 404s.

### Files touched (summary)
- [`dashboard.html`](dashboard.html), [`api.py`](api.py), [`syslog_server.py`](syslog_server.py), [`tftp_server.py`](tftp_server.py), [`noc_config.py`](noc_config.py). `retention_settings.py` removed.

## v0.5.5 — Interface Descriptions & Syslog States
**Released:** 2026-03-28

### Upcoming work
- **HTTPS for the dashboard** — switching from `http://localhost:5000` to HTTPS on the localhost API to avoid mixed/cleartext warnings when injecting passwords; plan is to add a self-signed cert loader and update `launcher.pyw`/`api.py` to serve TLS (feel free to flag if a CA cert or trust store change is needed).

## New Features
- **OLT model selector** — the OLT Connection Profile form now lets you choose between `V1600G1` and `V1600G1B`, stores the value in the db, and surfaces it in the registered OLT list.
- **Model-aware polling** — `V1600G1B` runs `int gpon 0/X` plus the appropriate `show pon onu all rx-power`/`show pon rx_power onu` commands while still collecting `show onu 1-128 distance`, so both OLT variants always get optical and distance data.
- **Robust ONU matching** — the parser merges `show onu info` and `show onu state` to build a reliable `onu_index`/`onu_id` map and picks the RX command that actually returns data, keeping optical power columns populated even when output formats differ.

### Fixed
- **ONU state accuracy** — `working` maps to `online`, other phase states map to offline while the dashboard reflects the correct online/offline counts.
- **Optical/distance fallback** — matches on ONU ID and skips `N/A` entries so V1600G1B profiles now show actual Rx power and distance metrics instead of gaps or placeholders.

### New Features
- **Syslog State Machine** — Devices now transition through **Receiving** (active), **Standby** (no logs for 2+ hours), and **Offline** (no logs for 24+ hours).
- **Interface Descriptions** — OLT Uplink cards now show the port description (e.g., "Uplink to Core") instead of just the raw interface name.
- **Navigation Reorganization** — Main tabs simplified to Syslog, SNMP Traps, TFTP Backups, Ping Monitor, and Alerts. OLT Devices merged into SNMP Traps view.
- **Improved Traffic Parsing** — Enhanced regex for Vsol CLI to accurately parse both `bytes/sec` and `bits/sec` traffic rates from `show interface`.
- **Automatic Multi-OLT Support** — TFTP and Syslog now better handle multiple OLTs behind the same NAT IP using the MAC mapping table.

### Fixed
- **Uplink Calculation** — Fixed Mbps calculation showing 0.00 for some Vsol firmware versions due to varying "bits/sec" vs "bytes/sec" labels.
- **Syslog Offline Detection** — Background thread now correctly marks inactive syslog emitters as Offline or Standby based on `last_seen`.
- **Navigation Highlight Bug** — Consistently highlights the active tab after reorganization.

- **Multiple uplink ports** — comma-separated in profile (e.g. `ge 0/10, ge 0/11`)
- **Export CSV** — download full ONU table
- **Poll history** — session log with duration, method, ONU count
- **Inline loading spinner** — shows on Connect button during poll, not fullscreen
- **Data saved to DB** — `olt.db` stores ONU snapshots and uplink stats history
- `paramiko` added to installer packages for SSH support

### Fixed
- Login loop after restart — `_SERVER_START` check was blocking valid logins (removed)
- `telnetlib` error on Python 3.13 — replaced with pure `socket` implementation
- SSH module errors now always fall back to Telnet automatically
- OLT API routes were registered after `if __name__` block — moved before main
- Add OLT Profile button did nothing — same route registration bug, fixed

### Notes
- `show onu optical-info` not supported on this OLT model — optical power column shows `—`
- Distance measurement not available via CLI on Vsol V1600G

## v0.5.5 â€” PostgreSQL Installer & Migration Hardening
**Updated:** 2026-04-02

### New Features
- **Unified setup launcher** â€” added `run.bat` as the main Windows entry point for install, PostgreSQL setup, PostgreSQL configuration, SQLite-to-PostgreSQL migration, and uninstall flows.
- **PostgreSQL auto-detection** â€” `setup_postgres.bat` now checks `PATH`, common `Program Files\PostgreSQL\*` locations, and versioned install folders before asking the user for a manual path.
- **Customer prerequisites guide** â€” added `README.md` with Python, PostgreSQL, firewall port, install, and migration prerequisites for fresh installs and upgrade scenarios.
- **Installer action support** â€” `setup.py` now supports `install`, `configure-postgres`, `migrate`, and `uninstall` actions so `run.bat` can drive the full lifecycle from one menu.

### Improved
- **Migration schema bootstrap** â€” `migrate_db.py` now creates the PostgreSQL schema before importing data, instead of assuming tables already exist.
- **Ping dashboard migration** â€” SQLite ping tables are now included in migration so the dashboard has its monitoring data after PostgreSQL cutover.
- **Migration rerun safety** â€” target PostgreSQL tables are truncated and identity sequences are resynchronized before and after import, making retry runs safer after partial failures.
- **Schema drift handling** â€” migration now imports only columns shared between SQLite and PostgreSQL and reports skipped legacy SQLite-only columns instead of crashing.
- **Dirty text cleanup** â€” migration strips embedded NUL characters from SQLite text rows before writing to PostgreSQL.
- **Result reporting** â€” install and migration scripts now return clearer success and failure states in the menu flow.

### Fixed
- **PostgreSQL auth mismatch** â€” default PostgreSQL app config now matches the initialized `adminsql` user instead of using the placeholder `postgres` credentials.
- **Manual PostgreSQL path prompt** â€” fixed delayed variable expansion in `setup_postgres.bat` so manually entered PostgreSQL `bin` paths are validated correctly.
- **Batch label errors** â€” removed fragile label-based migration flow in `run.bat` that could fail with `The system cannot find the batch label specified`.
- **False success after migration failure** â€” `setup.py` now exits with the correct status code for migration, preventing the menu from claiming success after Python errors.
- **Sequence sync on non-ID tables** â€” migration no longer tries to reset PostgreSQL sequences for tables that do not have an `id` column.

### Status
- **Version scope complete** â€” development changes for `v0.5.5` are complete.
- **Pending** â€” final production-machine validation is still pending before this version is considered fully signed off.
